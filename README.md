## Purpose of Project
ðŸ”¸ This is a beginner automation test project that utilizes Cypress.<br>
ðŸ”¸ It assumes you have the basic understanding of javascript, node, the cli & test automation as a whole.<br>
ðŸ”¸ The goal is to prove automation competency using our tool of choice by writing test scripts for a [sample e-commerce website.](https://automationexercise.com/)<br>
ðŸ”¸ I am literally learning how to use this tool as I go.

## Installation Guide
ðŸ”¸ This follows the [Cypress Docs](https://docs.cypress.io/) website to get us started.<br>
ðŸ”¸ Open up the folder where your project root is in VS Code.<br>
ðŸ”¸ Open up the terminal.<br>
ðŸ”¸ Verify you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed. This installation link should install npm & also add node to your `PATH` system environment variable automatically. Verify the installation on Windows:
```ps1
npm -v
# Expected output: 10.9.2 (Latest)

node -v
# Expected output: 23.9.0 (Latest)
```

ðŸ”¸ Run:
```ps1
npm install cypress --save-dev
```
ðŸ”¸ This will install the neccesary packaging needed for your project.<br>
ðŸ”¸ Open the Cypress UI:
```ps1
npx cypress open
```
ðŸ”¸ A separate pop-up window should appear where you can setup your project configuration.<br>
ðŸ”¸ Once you choose your browser, you can either setup your scripts via the UI or the `cy.js` files.<br>
ðŸ”¸ Run all tests headlessly be default:
```ps1
npx cypress run
```
ðŸ”¸ Run tests with the UI displaying:
```ps1
npx cypress run --headed
```
ðŸ”¸ My `package.json` files contains a script that allows us to run tests native to the 'e2e' folder using my browser choice of msedge:
```json
  "scripts": {
    "e2e:edge": "cypress run --browser edge"
  },
```
ðŸ”¸ You can run it from the terminal using:
```ps1
npm run e2e:edge
```
ðŸ”¸ Run specific test files:
```ps1
npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/name-of-file.cy.js"
```
## Additional Information
ðŸ”¸ I have the 'node_modules' folder added to the `.gitignore` file.<br> 
ðŸ”¸ In stricter cases, I might not do this. However, I don't care about reproducible builds here. Plus, we have a `package-lock.json` file included by git.<br>
ðŸ”¸ If you'd like a direct copy of my 'node_modules,' contact me.<br>
ðŸ”¸ The MIT liscense which allows us to use Cypress's software as my own was pulled from Cypress's GitHub repo & included [here](./LICENSE.txt) in the project's root.<br>
ðŸ”¸ [Click here](https://medium.com/@shalininagaraj1990/what-are-fixtures-in-cypress-5fd1ed0298b8) to find a good introductory article I found that explains how to use fixtures in Cypress.

## Environment Variables
ðŸ”¸ You'll need to add the following variables to your `.env` file:
```.env
TEST_PASSWORD=
TEST_MOBILE_NUMBER=
```
